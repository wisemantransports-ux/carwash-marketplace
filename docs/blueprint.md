- The visual scheme is light, reflecting the clean and refreshing nature of car wash services and a modern, trustworthy platform.
- Primary color: A clear and confident blue (#2080DF) selected to evoke professionalism, cleanliness, and trust in the marketplace.
- Background color: A very light, subtle blue (#F0F2F4) provides a crisp and clean canvas, harmonizing with the primary color while maintaining a neutral and expansive feel.
- Accent color: A vibrant cyan (#5EDDED) is used to draw attention to interactive elements and highlight key information, creating a dynamic yet complementary contrast.
- Body and headline font: 'Inter' (sans-serif) for its modern, clear, and highly readable characteristics, suitable for a functional interface across all screen types.
- Clean, modular layouts designed for effortless translation to Flutter, ensuring each screen component maps directly to a mobile-first paradigm and avoiding web-only patterns.
- Subtle, smooth transition animations for screen navigation and state changes to enhance user experience without disrupting the clean aesthetic.
